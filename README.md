# 4-level-menu-bootstrap-v5.3
Developers sometimes look for a 3- or 4-level menu on Bootstrap version 5.3. I present my version, developed together with DeepSeek

## Major fixes:
- Removed data-bs-toggle attributes for nested menus
- Simplified JavaScript logic for mobile devices
- Added important CSS style: display: block !important
- Improved click handling on mobile devices

## Test instructions:
1 Copy all the code to a file
2 Open it in a desktop browser
3 Hover over the appropriate levels
4 All levels should work
5 Open the page on a mobile device
6 Click on the menu icon (three stripes)
7 Click on "Main menu"
8 Click on "Third level" → should expand
9 Click on "Fourth level" → should expand

*All levels should work with smooth animation*
